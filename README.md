# Multi Tenant Saas Platform

This project is a multi-tenant SaaS platform for law firms. Each firm can register and manage its own clients, cases, documents, billing, and users. The challenge lies in ensuring that multiple firms (tenants) can coexist within the same system without their data overlapping, while keeping the platform scalable, secure, and efficient.

Key functionalities include:

Each law firm operates as an isolated tenant, managing its own set of users, clients, and cases.
Data Isolation between tenants is crucial to ensure that law firms can only access their own data.
Documents related to cases (like legal files or contracts) are uploaded and stored securely.
Billing systems ensure law firms can generate invoices for their services.

Relationship Diagram
To better understand the relationships, here’s how the entities would relate in a conceptual ER (Entity-Relationship) diagram:

``bash
LawFirm → has many → Users
LawFirm → has many → Clients
Client → has many → Cases
Case → has many → Documents
User ↔ Case (Many-to-Many relationship: Users can work on multiple cases, and cases can have multiple users assigned).
LawFirm → has many → Bills
Client → has many → Bills
``
### Data Isolation in Multi-Tenancy
Row-level tenancy: Each table has a tenant_id column to isolate data at the row level. For example, every row in the users, clients, and cases tables would have a tenant_id that corresponds to the law_firm_id.
Schema-level tenancy: Alternatively, you could assign each tenant (law firm) its own database schema to ensure stronger isolation but with more complexity in terms of deployment and maintenance.

### Scaling Considerations
Database Partitioning: As the system grows, it’s important to partition databases based on tenants. Large law firms could have their own dedicated database to avoid overwhelming the main database.
Caching: Use Redis to cache frequently accessed data, like lists of clients or cases.
Rate Limiting: Protect against abusive traffic (like bots) by setting rate limits for API calls, especially for case searches or document uploads.

### Security and Data Integrity
Encryption: All sensitive data (e.g., client details, case information) must be encrypted both at rest and in transit.
Authentication & Authorization: Use JWT tokens for authenticating API requests and implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users have appropriate access to client data.
